# potential
userland rgb control for the razer blade, without synapse

as it is, this project is not ready for use, although it does work. settings must be reapplied every startup.

this project is based on the excellent [openrazer](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer) project, and makes use of a modified version of [hidsharp](https://www.zer7.com/software/hidsharp).

## to-do:
- improve the interface
- add support for additional features
- add support for other razer peripherals other than the blade
- save/loading of configurations for devices
- auto-apply on startup
